Project Rover was a United States project to develop a nuclear-thermal rocket that ran from 1955 to 1973 at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. It began as a United States Air Force project to develop a nuclear-powered upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile. The project was transferred to NASA in 1958 after the Sputnik crisis triggered the Space Race. It was managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, a joint agency of the Atomic Energy Commission, and NASA. Project Rover became part of NASA Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application project and henceforth dealt with the research into nuclear rocket reactor design.
